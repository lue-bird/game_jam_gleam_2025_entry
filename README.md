## moon

submission for the [gleam game jam 2025](https://gamejam.gleam.community/)

```bash
gleam run -m lustre/dev start
```

## TODO
- optional: add music
- optional: add text and sound for ending
- optional: add animations for most things that have a sound and ending
- optional: background planets, in maybe trees
- no idea how: optimize

## what I learned
  - my slight dislike of gleam was unjustified
  - turns out lustre/dev was the program that used up more than 2GB of memory
