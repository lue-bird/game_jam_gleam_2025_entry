## moon

submission for the [gleam game jam 2025](https://gamejam.gleam.community/)

```bash
gleam run -m lustre/dev start
```

## TODO
- add diamonds to collect (should be in difficult to reach places)
- add death, diamond collect sound, switch out cloud bounce sound for something fluffy
- optional: add music
- optional: add text and sound for ending
- optional: add win condition like reaching the moon
- optional: add animations for most things that have a sound and ending
- optional: background planets, in maybe trees
- no idea how: optimize
