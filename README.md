## moon

submission for the [gleam game jam 2025](https://gamejam.gleam.community/).
[Open online](https://lue-bird.github.io/game_jam_gleam_2025_entry/) or run locally with
```bash
gleam run -m lustre/dev start
```
All assets and code made in jam time

-------

### development: consider
- add intro "cinematic" of lucy falling out of the sky
- background planets, shooting stars (higher up), and maybe trees at the bottom
- no idea how: optimize

### what I learned
  - my slight dislike of gleam was unjustified
  - rendering svgs in the browser is not all that fast
  - turns out lustre/dev was the program that used up more than 2GB of memory
  - I need to learn how to make non-cringe music
  - chrome and firefox render stroke-dasharray in combination with pathLength differently
