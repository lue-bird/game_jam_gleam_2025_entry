## moon

submission for the [gleam game jam 2025](https://gamejam.gleam.community/)

[Open online](https://lue-bird.github.io/game_jam_gleam_2025_entry/) or run locally with
```bash
gleam run -m lustre/dev start
```

-------

### development: consider
- add music
- add text and sound for ending
- add animations for most things that have a sound and ending
- background planets, in maybe trees
- no idea how: optimize

### what I learned
  - my slight dislike of gleam was unjustified
  - rendering svgs in the browser is not all that fast
  - turns out lustre/dev was the program that used up more than 2GB of memory
